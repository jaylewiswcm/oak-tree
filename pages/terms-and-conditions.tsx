                            <p>1.1 When the following words with capital letters are used in these Terms, this is what they will mean:</p>

                            <p>1.2 When we use the words “writing” or “written” in these Terms, this will include e-mail unless we say otherwise.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>Our contract with you</b></p>
                            <p>2.1 These are the terms and conditions on which we will supply Goods to you.</p>
                            <p>2.2 Please ensure that you read these Terms carefully, and check that the details on the Order and in these Terms are complete and accurate, before you sign the Order. If you think that there is a mistake, please contact us to discuss it. We will confirm any changes in writing to avoid any confusion between you and us.</p>
                            <p>2.3 The terms of any sales, special offers or other promotions will be published on Our website or on any printed advertisement or promotional materials and will apply in addition to these Terms.</p>
                            <p>2.4 Once you have signed the Order, a legally binding contract will come into existence between you and us. A copy of the Order will be given to you at the time of signing. The number of your Order will be printed on the Order and you should quote this number in all subsequent correspondence with us relating to the Order.</p>
                            <p>2.5 The images of the Goods on our website or in our catalogue or brochure are for illustrative purposes only. We have made every effort to display the colours accurately, however we cannot guarantee that your computer’s or device’s display of the colours or the printed pictures accurately reflect the colour of the Goods. Your Goods may vary slightly from those images.</p>
                            <p>2.6 Although we make every effort to be as accurate as possible, measurements for Bespoke Goods shall be subject to a tolerance of one inch in respect of each measurement.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><b>3. Changes to your Order or these Terms</b></p>
                            <p>3.1 We may revise these Terms from time to time in order to respond to changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements or to follow best practice.</p>
                            <p>3.2 Where we revise any of these Terms under clause 3.1 and those changes affect the contract between you and Us, We will give you at least two weeks’ written notice of those changes before they take effect.</p>
                            <p>3.3 If you wish to cancel an Order before it has been fulfilled, please see your right to do so in clause 11. In the case of Bespoke Goods, unfortunately, because we make these Goods to your specific requirements, you will not be able to cancel an Order once it is made.</p>
                            <p>3.4 Your cancellation rights are described in clause 11.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p><b>4. Delivery of goods</b></p>
                            <p>4.1 We will provide you with an estimated delivery date on the Order. While we will use our best efforts to deliver the Goods by the estimated delivery date, any dates that we specify for delivery of the Goods are approximate only.</p>
                            <p>4.2 Timescales for delivery will vary depending on the availability of the Goods (or any parts, fabrics or other materials), the complexity of any Order for Bespoke Goods and, in certain circumstances, your delivery address. You should allow extra time for deliveries to Northern Ireland and the Scottish Highlands. We will only deliver Goods within the UK mainland and Northern Ireland.</p>
                            <p>4.3 We will contact you nearer the estimated delivery date to confirm the actual delivery date with you. We will also give you the option to pay the balance of the price for the Goods in accordance with clause 8.6. We will confirm the estimated time of delivery on the day before or on the day of delivery by telephone.</p>
                            <p>4.4 Where it appears that the scheduled delivery date will be missed then we will provide you with a revised delivery date, which will not be more than 14 days from the scheduled delivery date.</p>
                            <p>4.5 Occasionally our delivery to you may be affected by an Event Outside Our Control. Please see clause 10 for our responsibilities when this happens.</p>
                            <p>4.6 If no one is available at your address to take delivery on the date and at the time notified to you, then We will leave you a note that the Goods have been returned to Our warehouse, in which case, you should contact Us to rearrange delivery. We may charge a re-delivery fee of £215 (including VAT) in these circumstances.</p>
                            <p>4.7 Where we have revised the delivery date under clause 4.4 and subsequently failed to deliver the Goods within 14 days from the scheduled delivery date, or we agreed on a specific delivery date with you and have missed that date, then you may cancel your Order in respect of some of all of the Goods straight away. Alternatively, you can give ask us to deliver the Goods on a date more convenient for you (which must be reasonable). If any of the Goods have already been delivered to you, you will have to return them to us or allow us to collect them, and we will pay the costs of this. After you cancel your Order We will refund any sums you have paid to us for the cancelled Goods and their delivery (where applicable).</p>
                            <p>4.8 Delivery of an Order shall be completed when we deliver the Goods to the address you gave us and the Goods will be your responsibility from that time. You may want to contact your insurance provider to ensure that the Goods are included within the scope of your home and contents insurance policy.</p>
                            <p>4.9 You own the Goods once we have received payment in full.</p>

                            <p><b>6. Guarantees of the Goods</b></p>
                            <p>6.1 The guarantees referred to in this clause are in addition to any warranties that we may offer, as referred to in clause 7. In any event, nothing will affect your legal rights in relation to Goods that are faulty or not as described. Advice about your legal rights is available from your local Citizens’ Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office (see links referred to in clause 5).</p>
                            <p>6.2 Where any Goods come with a manufacturer’s guarantee, you should refer to the terms of such guarantee as provided with the Goods.</p>
                            <p>6.3 Where any Goods do not come with a manufacturer’s guarantee, we guarantee that on delivery and for a period of 12 months from delivery, the Goods shall be free from material defects. However, this guarantee does not apply in the circumstances described in clause 6.4.</p>
                            <p>6.4 This guarantee does not apply to any defect in the Goods arising from:</p>
                            <p>6.4.1 fair wear and tear;</p>
                            <p>6.4.2 Willful damage, abnormal storage or working conditions, accident, negligence by you or by any third party;</p>
                            <p>6.4.3 if you fail to operate or use the Goods in accordance with the user instructions; and</p>
                            <p>6.4.4 any alteration or repair by you or by a third party who is not one of our authorised repairers.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><b>7. Warranties</b></p>
                            <p>The Goods purchased are Warranted from the date of Delivery against faults arising due to defects in manufacture of materials according to the Warranty stated on the Order. Parts replaced under this Warranty will be covered for the balance of the Warranty period.</p>
                            <p>The Warranty does not provide cover for wear and tear, such items as batteries, upholstery, or any other item which may need replacing due to normal wear and tear or misuse of the product. Call-out and/or labour charges may apply at the Buyer’s expense.</p>
                            <p>After the warranty period expires the Seller reserves the right of discretion to repair faults and to charge a reasonable fee for any work undertaken at that time (not applicable to lifetime warranty customers).</p>
                            <p>The Warranty is between the Seller and the Buyer of the Goods purchased and is non-transferable.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p>8. Price and payment</p>
                            <p>8.2 If you have a long-term illness or disability, you may not have to pay VAT on the Goods. If you are eligible or believe that you may be eligible, to claim VAT relief on the Goods, then you will be asked to sign a declaration as part of the Order. You should note that there are penalties for making false declarations and if you are in any doubt as to eligibility, you should contact the VAT Enquiries Office on 0300 200 3700.</p>
                            <p>8.3 Unless you are eligible to claim VAT relief as described in clause 8.2, our prices include VAT. However, if the rate of VAT changes between the date of the Order and the date of delivery or performance, We will adjust the rate of VAT that you pay, unless you have already paid for the Goods in full before the change in the rate of VAT takes effect.</p>
                            <p>8.4 We offer free delivery on all Orders within mainland UK and Northern Ireland.</p>
                            <p>8.5 It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Goods We sell may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices as part of our despatch procedures so that, where the Goods’ correct price is less than our stated price, We will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Goods to you. If the correct price of the Goods is higher than the price stated on our website or in any catalogue or brochure or price list, we will contact you to tell you and ask for your instructions.</p>
                            <p>8.6 We require the payment of a 50% deposit for the Goods at the time of your Order. Until payment of the deposit has been received, we will be unable to process your Order. Without affecting your rights of cancellation and refund under clause 11 and your right to a refund if we exercise our rights of cancellation under clause 12, all deposits shall be non-refundable.</p>
                            <p>8.7 If you have not paid the balance or are unable to pay the balance at the time we call you, then We will be entitled to reschedule your delivery to ensure your balance is settled before the goods are delivered.</p>
                            <p>8.8 We accept payment by cash, cheque, credit or debit card (Visa Debit, Visa Credit, Mastercard and Maestro). We do not accept payment by Diners Club or American Express. We are unable to accept cash payments of outstanding balances on delivery.</p>

Loss or damage is foreseeable if it is an obvious consequence of our breach or if it was envisaged by you and us at the time we entered into this contract.</p>
                            <p>9.2 Where we are installing the Goods in your property, we will make good any damage to your property caused by Us (which includes Our subcontractors) in the course of installation or performance.

                            <p>11.5.1 We can withhold refunds until goods are returned (or evidence of return is provided) and the amount of money refunded can be reduced where evidence shows use beyond the handling necessary.</p>
