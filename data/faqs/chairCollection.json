        "question": "How much are rise and recline chairs?",
        "answer" : "Every product we make is different, built for the specific needs of its user. No two pieces of furniture are the same: our choices of styles, fabrics, sizes, and accessories add up to make an almost limitless number of combinations. Because of that, it is impossible for us to say how much a chair, bed, or stairlift will cost until we know exactly what you want. That is why we strongly recommend booking a no-obligation appointment with one of our home consultants, who can help you choose something that perfectly meets your needs and leave you with a price based on all your choices. There will be no pressure, and you will be left to consider the quote in your own time."
